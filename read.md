# FastAPI Microservice Architecture

This FastAPI microservice is structured into the following layers:

1. **API Layer**:
   - Handles HTTP requests and responses.
   - Defines the endpoints and their corresponding request methods (e.g., GET, POST).
   - Uses FastAPI's routing and dependency injection features.
   - Example: `@app.get("/items/")` or `@app.post("/users/")`.

2. **Service Layer**:
   - Contains the business logic of the application.
   - Processes data received from the API layer and interacts with the repository layer.
   - Ensures separation of concerns by keeping the API layer lightweight.

3. **Repository Layer**:
   - Handles database interactions.
   - Contains functions for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
   - Abstracts the database logic from the service layer.

4. **Models Layer**:
   - Defines the data structures used in the application.
   - Includes Pydantic models for request/response validation and SQLAlchemy models for database schema.

5. **Configuration Layer**:
   - Manages application settings and environment variables.
   - Uses libraries like `pydantic.BaseSettings` for configuration management.

6. **Utilities Layer**:
   - Contains helper functions and reusable utilities.
   - Examples include logging, error handling, or authentication helpers.

7. **Testing Layer**:
   - Includes unit tests and integration tests for the application.
   - Uses tools like `pytest` and FastAPI's `TestClient` for testing.

Each layer is designed to ensure modularity, maintainability, and scalability of the microservice.
